First, I need to extract key facts from the document and output a single JSON object. Must be JSON only, no text outside.
Identify numerical data points: deforestation, CO emissions, pollution, quantities, finance, climate, rates, land degradation, projections, etc., temperature, sea level, plastic, production, people, species, temporal, affected, etc.
Each with unit and context, page or chart type.
Chart type.
Document is French, so I need to understand content about glacial ice loss, sea ice.
Ice loss, area, temperature, sea level rise, Greenland, etc.
Key phrases: "dimin million km² per year, percentage, mm, percentage, mm, etc.
Extract data over time.
Format: line for evolution, bar, pie, etc.
Output JSON per data point.
Structure: { "key": "", "value", "unit": "", "context", "page": "", "chart": ""
First page number or chart type.
From example, but not sure.
I think "page"page" is where found, like the page number or context or source? No, but example has "page": "page" in the example "share of data object, probably typo.
Example: "page"page": "0" might be page number or something else.
In example it's "page": "page" probably typo, in context or page number.
In example it's "page: "page": "0" value or something.
Look at example: in output: { "key": "": "value", "5", "unit"", "": "share"", "global"",page"",0", "Pie"Chart""} so probably page is part of object key.
Each object has key, value, unit, context, page, chart.
page? But page what is? In context? In example "share of data, probably page number or source or context.
In document page number.
In example it's "page"page" might be the page number where it was extracted from or context, like source.
But in text.
Assume page is like page number or section.
In document.
Document has no page numbers, but I think.
Extract all together.
First identify numerical data.
