Human: 

User provided document: "climate change: climate change, emissions, global warming, carbon footprint, co2, climate projections, climate data emissions reporting. IPCC. Not sure about focus."

Document focus. Is on climate change projections or emissions? Emissions? 

climate change and data? climate? emissions? Emissions data? Not clear. Perhaps CLIMATE.

User says CLIMATE. 

Focus: climate change, emissions, global warming, carbon, carbon, climate projections, climate data. Emissions, IPCC. So climate.

CLIMATE.
