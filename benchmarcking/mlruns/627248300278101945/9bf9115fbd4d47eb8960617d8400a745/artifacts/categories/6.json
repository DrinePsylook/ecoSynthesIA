First, user's message: I am an expert tasked with categorizing documents based on a given taxonomy. Must choose one category from list: CLIMATE, BIODS, BIODIVERSITY, POLUTIONAL, ECOAL, NATURAL, ENERGY, TRANSITION, POLIC, POL, SOCIOCONOMIC, ECON, RISKS, RSKS. Document must reflect at least 50% of content. Answer just category name like CLIMATE or BIOD.

 Document: It's about EU policy coordination environmental initiatives, partnerships, funding, climate, biodiversity, nature, pollution, etc. Focuses. Has keywords like climate change, biodiversity, emissions, emissions, so fits CLIMATE. Probably CLIOD.

Document is best match.
