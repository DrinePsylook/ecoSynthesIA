We are going to extract data from the provided text. The goal is to extract numerical facts from document output JSON, single object. Must be JSON only no text outside. Key extract: data, For each point value, provide unit, context, output JSON. Goal extract available: Deforestation, CO emissions, quantities, pollution, finance, climate, rates, land degradation, projections, temperatures, sea level, plastic, production, people, species, temporal, countries. Temporal periods. Data can text or graphs. Structure JSON, each object with keys "value", "value"", "context"", "page"chart" and " for visualization. Chart type: Line for time, Bar, Bar, Pie, Pie, Map. Example given. Document seems messy. Ignore metadata. Scan for numbers. 

First, look for numbers. "2197" might be typo for 219, but ignore. "0, "8" might8" or something. "Page" not number. "Page" not data. Then "7"Document" probably page number. No. Content: "0"Paper0 recycled10" might be 0% "10" but percentage? Not clear. "Panda" might typo. "WWF World Fund". No number. "20" Brussels" not number. "contact". No clear numbers. Maybe "208% recycled? "Recycled" perhaps 2%". Then "0" Maybe "Page"7" as page number. But not. No. Perhaps "10"Page" as value. Wait, "7 as page. In context. Not numerical. "Page. But not typically not data. "page" orchart" key. Definition. Ignore. Only data. Perhaps "210" might be part of "0. Not. "8. Not. Not clear. "Page. Perhaps "7" as value. "page" but no. "context"Page"Page" is not defined. Data. "page"page" in chart? No. In chart type. Chart type. "page"Page" not defined. Perhaps typo. "page. No data. No numbers. "page. "Page" in text. Wait, page. "Page 7" is not data. But "page. No. "Page number. Only numerical values. "0, 0"0,1, but "0, "8, "0". But "0". "0" "0" might "0" not numerical. "0. "8" "8" 8" not. No. "Page7. "7" not. "7.
