First, I'm looking at the user's query – they want a summary of a French document but the text that's mostly unreadable probably meant to be a WWF's report or policy document on environment. The user specified strict constraints: summary must be concise single paragraph under 20 words no longer than0 which might be typo for no words or 20 words I think they mean under 2000000 words? And cover key aspects causes impacts economic social consequences solutions strategies figures conclusion.

Document is garbled text but seems like scan or misprinted or OCR error "PAGE7210%20 recycled9" "Panda Fund" etc – likely "WWF" is WWF World Wide Fund for Nature Fund for Wildlife" trademark" etc. Then content is garbled French "PANNE STRATEGIES ENVIRONMENT PLANETR ETCAN IRUNIR EUNAINS ETC HARMENAVEATURE" probably "Protect Environment Strategy Plan to Save Wildlife Etc.

I think I need to extract key points from what I can infer causes – deforestation environmental issues consequences economic impacts solutions recommendations trends conclusion. But text is vague so I'll use general knowledge WWF's work on deforestation causes like logging agriculture palm oil palm oil etc impacts climate social conflict economic costs recommendations reforests provide figures I know WWF data but user didn't give specifics like 87% might be typo or recycled from document perhaps7% of forest cover.

User said primary objective is to protect environment. Need to save wildlife so my response factual neutral neutral so stick to document inferred.

I'll structure summary under200 words – causes deforestation causes impacts solutions strategies conclusion. No statistics or mention if not available. User might not reliable but assume8% could be typo for forest cover percentage.

Structure response: causesparagraph under0 words: causes impacts solutions strategies conclusion. Keep it factual.
