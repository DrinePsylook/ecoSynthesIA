DATA_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert data extraction assistant. Your task is to identify and extract key numerical data and facts from a document. The output must be a single JSON object. Do not include any text outside the JSON.
"""
# `user_prompt` for instructions and document content
DATA_EXTRACTION_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Extract key data from the following document. For each data point, provide its value, unit, and context. The output must be a valid JSON object.
Your goal is to extract the following data, if available:
- Deforestation and CO2 emissions figures.
- Quantities of plastic pollution.
- Financial amounts related to climate finance.
- Rates and percentages of land degradation.
- Projections (e.g., temperature, sea level, plastic production).
- Number of people, species, or countries affected.
- Temporal data (periods, specific years).
Data can be un text, in tables, or in graphs.

Structure your response in JSON format, without additional explanatory text. Use one JSON object per type of extracted data. Each object must contain the keys "value", "unit", "context", "page" where you find the information and "chart".

The "chart" key must contain the most appropriate visualization type for the extracted data, based on these definitions:
- **LineChart**: Best for showing a variable's evolution over time (trends, years).
- **BarChart**: Excellent for comparing data between different categories or entities (e.g., countries, types of pollution, financial amounts).
- **PieChart**: Used to show the proportion of each category relative to a whole (percentages, shares, parts of a total).
- **ChoroplethMap**: Essential for geographical data (regional distribution, country comparison).

Here is an example of the desired output format for a hypothetical document:
```json
{
  "key_data_name": {
    "value": "25",
    "unit": "%",
    "context": "share of global emissions",
    "page": 10,
    "chart": "PieChart"
  }
}
