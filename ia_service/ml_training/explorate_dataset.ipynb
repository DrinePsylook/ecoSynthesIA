more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.   \n",
      "1  It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.   \n",

Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increased frequency did however correlate to lower odds of needing blood pressure drugs, with 41% lower probability than someone visiting less than once a week.“Mounting scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of nature exposure is likely to increase the supply of high-quality green spaces in urban environments and promote their active use,” the researchers wrote. “This might be one way to improve health and welfare in cities.”Their research is published online in the journal Occupational & Environmental Medicine.   \n",

It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup. Return to a boil, then serve.Prep 1 hrCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4-62 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (about 140g)1 rainbow carrot, grated with the skin on (about 140g)180g cooked and peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed40g sunflower seeds1 tsp thyme leaves½ tbsp chopped sage leaves1 tsp ground coriander¼ tsp nutmeg50g black or green lentils50g pearl barley, or rice2 tsp Marmite40g pinhead oats, or rolled oats40g ground almondsSea salt and black pepper4-5 outer red cabbage leavesPut the olive oil in a pan on medium heat, then saute the shallots and grated carrot for 10 minutes. Stir in the chestnuts, garlic, sunflower seeds, thyme, sage, ground coriander and nutmeg, then add the lentils and pearl barley. Stir in the Marmite and 350ml water, cover, bring up to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 35 minutes, or until the barley and lentils are very tender and the texture is like a dry risotto. Stir in the oats and almonds, then season generously.Meanwhile, in a large pan of boiling water, blanch the red cabbage leaves for five minutes, then drain.Grease a 1kg bread tin or enamel dish with olive oil, then line it with the cabbage leaves, making sure they overlap. Tightly pack the chestnut mixture into the cabbage-lined vessel, then fold the overhanging leaves over the top, so sealing the filling inside. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 45 minutes, then remove and leave to settle and rest for at least five minutes. Carefully turn out on to a serving board, then take to the table, slice and serve with all the Christmas trimmings.   \n",

Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic. Marie Baynham-Davies, Halesworth, Suffolk ‘At least a dozen red admirals at one time’A red admiral spotted on Sean’s fig tree on 11 September. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country. Geoff Pike, 70, Dorset ‘They are plentiful in our area’A marbled white butterfly on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.

       "Article Text      It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.\n",

                                                                                                                                                               Liz Truss will sign off on a push for more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.   \n",
      "1  It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.   \n",

Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increased frequency did however correlate to lower odds of needing blood pressure drugs, with 41% lower probability than someone visiting less than once a week.“Mounting scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of nature exposure is likely to increase the supply of high-quality green spaces in urban environments and promote their active use,” the researchers wrote. “This might be one way to improve health and welfare in cities.”Their research is published online in the journal Occupational & Environmental Medicine.   \n",

It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup. Return to a boil, then serve.Prep 1 hrCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4-62 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (about 140g)1 rainbow carrot, grated with the skin on (about 140g)180g cooked and peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed40g sunflower seeds1 tsp thyme leaves½ tbsp chopped sage leaves1 tsp ground coriander¼ tsp nutmeg50g black or green lentils50g pearl barley, or rice2 tsp Marmite40g pinhead oats, or rolled oats40g ground almondsSea salt and black pepper4-5 outer red cabbage leavesPut the olive oil in a pan on medium heat, then saute the shallots and grated carrot for 10 minutes. Stir in the chestnuts, garlic, sunflower seeds, thyme, sage, ground coriander and nutmeg, then add the lentils and pearl barley. Stir in the Marmite and 350ml water, cover, bring up to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 35 minutes, or until the barley and lentils are very tender and the texture is like a dry risotto. Stir in the oats and almonds, then season generously.Meanwhile, in a large pan of boiling water, blanch the red cabbage leaves for five minutes, then drain.Grease a 1kg bread tin or enamel dish with olive oil, then line it with the cabbage leaves, making sure they overlap. Tightly pack the chestnut mixture into the cabbage-lined vessel, then fold the overhanging leaves over the top, so sealing the filling inside. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 45 minutes, then remove and leave to settle and rest for at least five minutes. Carefully turn out on to a serving board, then take to the table, slice and serve with all the Christmas trimmings.   \n",

Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic. Marie Baynham-Davies, Halesworth, Suffolk ‘At least a dozen red admirals at one time’A red admiral spotted on Sean’s fig tree on 11 September. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country. Geoff Pike, 70, Dorset ‘They are plentiful in our area’A marbled white butterfly on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.

      "Scottish government rejected a new links at Coul to protect the complex dune system but investors have revived the scheme\n",
      "It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.\n"

after reports her team have met energy firms\\n\\nPolitics live – latest updates\\n\\nLiz Truss will sign off on a push for more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.  \n",
      "1  Scottish government rejected a new links at Coul to protect the complex dune system but investors have revived the scheme\\nIt is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.  \n",

Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increased frequency did however correlate to lower odds of needing blood pressure drugs, with 41% lower probability than someone visiting less than once a week.“Mounting scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of nature exposure is likely to increase the supply of high-quality green spaces in urban environments and promote their active use,” the researchers wrote. “This might be one way to improve health and welfare in cities.”Their research is published online in the journal Occupational & Environmental Medicine.  \n",

It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup. Return to a boil, then serve.Prep 1 hrCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4-62 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (about 140g)1 rainbow carrot, grated with the skin on (about 140g)180g cooked and peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed40g sunflower seeds1 tsp thyme leaves½ tbsp chopped sage leaves1 tsp ground coriander¼ tsp nutmeg50g black or green lentils50g pearl barley, or rice2 tsp Marmite40g pinhead oats, or rolled oats40g ground almondsSea salt and black pepper4-5 outer red cabbage leavesPut the olive oil in a pan on medium heat, then saute the shallots and grated carrot for 10 minutes. Stir in the chestnuts, garlic, sunflower seeds, thyme, sage, ground coriander and nutmeg, then add the lentils and pearl barley. Stir in the Marmite and 350ml water, cover, bring up to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 35 minutes, or until the barley and lentils are very tender and the texture is like a dry risotto. Stir in the oats and almonds, then season generously.Meanwhile, in a large pan of boiling water, blanch the red cabbage leaves for five minutes, then drain.Grease a 1kg bread tin or enamel dish with olive oil, then line it with the cabbage leaves, making sure they overlap. Tightly pack the chestnut mixture into the cabbage-lined vessel, then fold the overhanging leaves over the top, so sealing the filling inside. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 45 minutes, then remove and leave to settle and rest for at least five minutes. Carefully turn out on to a serving board, then take to the table, slice and serve with all the Christmas trimmings.  \n",

Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic. Marie Baynham-Davies, Halesworth, Suffolk ‘At least a dozen red admirals at one time’A red admiral spotted on Sean’s fig tree on 11 September. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country. Geoff Pike, 70, Dorset ‘They are plentiful in our area’A marbled white butterfly on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.
